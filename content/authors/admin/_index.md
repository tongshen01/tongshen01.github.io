I'm currently a senior undergraduate at Department of Physics, Fudan University. My research interests include elementry particle physics, phenomenology and machine learning. 

I'm very honored to be advised by [Prof. Jiayin Gu](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/4b/db/c7605a412635/page.htm) from Department of Physics, Fudan University. I was also advised by [Prof. Zhen Liu](https://cse.umn.edu/physics/zhen-liu) from School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota when I stayed at UMN in June ~ Sep, 2023 as a visiting student intern.

**I'm applying for Ph.D program starting from 2024 Fall.**
