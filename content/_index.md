        - title: Machine-Learned Jet Time and Trackless Jet Vertexing

              We demonstrate that precision timing information of the jet constituents in conjunction with machine learning allows for a more precise definition of jet time and also an independent reconstruction of displaced vertices for trackless jets. This highlights the power and importance of timing information for jets in colliders, which is complementary to tracking information for heavy neutral long-lived particles. Our new definition of jet time performs four times better than the old definition on average. The time-based vertices reconstruction has proved to have considerable precision for trackless jets with large decay radius.

        - title: Machine Learning Approach for Top Quark Effective Theory
          company: Advised by [Prof. Jiayin Gu](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/4b/db/c7605a412635/page.htm), Fudan University

          description: |2-
              We focus on the effective field theory which may influence the generation and decay of top quarks in future colliders. Machine learning techniques are applied to analyze the data generated by Madgraph and detector simulations. We use the likelihood score as the target function and Fisher information as the evaluation method. This enables us to estimate constraints on the coefficients of effective theory.
